After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the five parts of a function definition?
  function keyword, optional name, comma-separated list of zero or more parameters surrounded by (), start of code block {, optional return statement, end of the function's code block }
- How do you call a function?

ex. if the function was addNumbers(x,y) with two inputs then you do:
addNumbers(x,y);

A parameter is what you put into the function and is a placeholder for a variable that you will put into the function when you call the function. An argument is what the function does. You pass arguments to the function when you call the function.
