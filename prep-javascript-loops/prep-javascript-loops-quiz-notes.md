## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?

To determine if the statement should be executed. If the condition is true, the statement is executed and vice versa.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?

evaluated once before the loop begins

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?

evaluated before each loop iteration

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?

evaluated at the end of each loop, before the next evaluation of condition

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
  It is usually used to update or increment the counter variable initialized.

  Objects, like arrays, where the properties of the object are enumberable, non-symbol properties. Don't use it if the index order of the array is important.
